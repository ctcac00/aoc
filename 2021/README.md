I'm trying to learn golang so I'm doing the Advent of Code 2021 where I'll have to complete different challenges everyday and hopefully improve my skills on go.

I'm happy to get PR requests if you think there is a better way to get to the result!

To get the answers to the challenges simply run go (or go run...) on the respective file, like:

```bash
go run d1/p1/d1p1.go
```

Go to [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/) to learn more.
